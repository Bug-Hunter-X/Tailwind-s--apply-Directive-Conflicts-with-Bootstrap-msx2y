# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Conflict with Bootstrap

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within a CSS file that is also using Bootstrap.

The `@apply` directive may conflict with Bootstrap's CSS rules or classes, leading to unexpected styling behaviors.

## Problem Description

The `bug.css` file shows how the `@apply` directive causes unexpected styling problems when combined with Bootstrap.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file illustrates how to resolve this issue by replacing the `@apply` directive with direct Tailwind utility classes.

This approach ensures that Tailwind CSS utility classes are applied correctly without interfering with Bootstrap's styling.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2.  Use a compatible project setup that includes both Tailwind and Bootstrap.
